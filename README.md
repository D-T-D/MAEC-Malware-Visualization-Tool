====================================================
    MAEC Visualization Tool
====================================================

=========================    
    PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
=========================

        This tool was developed for my final year thesis titled, 'Visualization Of Malware Data Using MAEC'.

        One of the deliverables of this project was developing a tool that could read in and visualize MAEC (Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization) 
        files and display the data as a connected graph. 

        This was designed to be a web-based tool allowing for the upload of a MAEC XML file and handling the
        processing of the data. 
        
        The result of this provides the user with a table containing the name, number, and color identifier of each MAEC tag that was discovered.
        
        Additionally, the main visualization graphic is displayed below the table in a hierarchical layout based on the MAEC data's file structure.

        The tree-graph is interactive allowing for the capability of collapsing / expanding nodes, navigating the entire graph, and viewing and extracting tag-specific information by simply hovering over a node to display the tooltips.

===================
    MOTIVATION:
===================

        The motivating force behind this project is the lack of any available tools which can visualize MAEC data. By developing a tool that could read in and visualize MAEC files, this is contributing towards the research and solutions available for visualizing MAEC data, and filling in the current gap. This provides opportunities for anybody who may wish to further improve the solutions and research pertaining to this specific topic given there is now a tool which can carry out this specific task.

=================
    FEATURES: 
=================

        - Upload Button which allows users to navigate their file explorer and upload their own MAEC files.
        - Interactive Table with various types of information about the uploaded file. Selecting any tag in the table allows for quick filtering within the visualization below.- Interactive Visualization represented as a hierarchial tree-graph with expandible and collapsible nodes. Structured according to the MAEC tags within the file.
        - Easily extractible data from any specific node within the tree-graph through a tooltip which appears on hover.

=====================
    INSTALLATION: 
=====================

        Nothing! The tool utilizes jsDelivr to serve up all of the required packages and pre-requisites from the npm registry and as a result, everything functions within the browser without any extra hassle. If a user wishes to edit the configuration or format, they can do so after reading the appropriate instructions.

===================
    HOW TO USE:
===================

        The most simple use case for running the MAEC visualization tool is dragging the 'visualizer.html' file into your favorite web browser. A few of the tested supported browsers are Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. Internet Explorer is NOT SUPPORTED and the tool will not function properly within that browser.

        After the html page is served up in the browser, the main page is shown requiring a user to upload a MAEC file formatted in XML to produce the visualization.

        Click on the upload button, select a MAEC file with XML format, wait for processing and rendering to take place, and explore the table and graph.

        Additionally, MAEC tags can be filtered down using the search bar funcitonality within the table. And if any row containing a MAEC tag is selected, all of the nodes in the visualization graph below will be expanded and highlighted automatically to allow for easily locating the attributes you're after. 

        To expand or collapse nodes in the table, simply click the circle to perform this action. Hover over a node to see additional information which can be copied.

        Finally, extra configuration is possible within the 'constants.js' file in the tool's code. Navigate to the file and follow the format and instructions which are fully commented. Any MAEC tags and colors can be assigned by adding a new tag to the array. After saving this file, the next time a file is uploaded the color identifiers will apply to those nodes and tags in the table as specified within the configuration file.

        If the tool is performing poorly, the boolean operator at the end of the 'constants.js' file can be set to false. This will prevent the visualization graph from being fully expanded after a file is uploaded. This will significantly improve performance, and the user can then manually expand nodes or use the filtering function on the table to only expand certain groups of nodes which need to be examined. (Any MAEC files over 40MB in size have shown to cause some performance issues when every single node is expanded and rendered in on the graph. Though this can also vary depending on the host machine's specifications.)


        (A large collection of MAEC sample files are included with this tool and are assorted by their size and complexity.)

        MAEC_Class1.xml -->	200 lines or less	
        MAEC_Class2.xml	--> 500 lines or less	
        MAEC_Class3.xml	--> 1500 lines or less	
        MAEC_Class4.xml	--> 5000 lines or less	
        MAEC_Class5.xml	--> 10,000 lines or more

        (Please excercise caution when attempting to upload the Stress Test MAEC files. These are larger than average and 'Stress_Test_3.xml' will not render successfully if the 'INITIALLY_EXPANDED' variable is set to true in the configuration file.)
